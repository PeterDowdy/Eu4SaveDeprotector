==================

This deprotects EU4 save games. To use it, start the application, then select the protected save game you want to deprotect. Follow the instructions on-screen.

Once the tool has completed its work, open the save in singleplayer in EU4. Then, save the save again. This will save it in text format and you can edit it however you like from here on.
